# 7.3 Sparse Arrays

A sparse array is one in which the elements do not have contiguous indexes starting at
0. Normally, the length property of an array specifies the number of elements in the
array. If the array is sparse, the value of the length property is greater than the number
of elements. Sparse arrays can be created with the Array() constructor or simply by
assigning to an array index larger than the current array length .
