This book introduces you to Node, the new web development framework written in JavaScript. You'll learn hands-on how Node makes life easier for experienced JavaScript developers: not only can you work on the front end and back end in the same language, you'll also have more flexibility in choosing how to divide application logic between client and server.<br />
<br />
Written by a core contributor to the framework, Node: Up and Running shows you how Node scales up to support large numbers of simultaneous connections across multiple servers, and scales down to let you create quick one-off applications with minimal infrastructure. Built on the V8 JavaScript engine that runs Google Chrome, Node is already winning the hearts and minds of many companies, including Google and Yahoo! This book shows you why.<br />
<br />
Understand Node's event-loop architecture, non-blocking I/O, and event-driven programming<br />
Discover how Node supports a variety of database and data storage tools<br />
Learn best practices for writing easy-to-maintain code for Node<br />
Get concrete examples of how to use the various Node APIs in practice<br />
Take advantage of the bookâ€™s complete API reference<br />
