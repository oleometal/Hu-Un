                        Edward Snowden, el hombre que arriesgó todo para exponer el sistema de vigilancia masiva del gobierno de EE. UU., Revela por primera vez la historia de su vida, incluida la forma en que ayudó a construir ese sistema y lo que lo motivó a intentar derribarlo.

En 2013, Edward Snowden, de veintinueve años, conmocionó al mundo cuando rompió con el establecimiento de inteligencia estadounidense y reveló que el gobierno de los Estados Unidos estaba buscando secretamente los medios para recoger cada llamada telefónica, mensaje de texto y correo electrónico. El resultado sería un sistema de vigilancia masiva sin precedentes con la capacidad de entrometerse en la vida privada de cada persona en la tierra. Seis años más tarde, Snowden revela por primera vez cómo ayudó a construir este sistema y por qué se movió para exponerlo.

Abarcando los bucólicos suburbios de Beltway de su infancia y las publicaciones clandestinas de la CIA y la NSA de su edad adulta, el Registro Permanente es el relato extraordinario de un joven brillante que creció en línea: un hombre que se convirtió en espía, denunciante y, en el exilio, La conciencia de Internet. Escrito con ingenio, gracia, pasión y una franqueza inquebrantable, Registro permanente es una memoria crucial de nuestra era digital y está destinado a ser un clásico.

                        Using Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) for illustrations only scratches the surface of this format’s potential on the web. With this practical guide, you’ll learn how to use SVG not only for illustrations but also as graphical documents that you can integrate into complex HTML5 web pages, and style with custom CSS. Web developers will discover ways to adapt designs by adding data based graphics, dynamic styles, interaction, or animation.

                        Divided into five parts, this book includes:
                        
                        SVG on the web: Understand how SVG works with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to define graphics
                        Drawing with markup: Learn the vector language of x and y coordinates that let SVG create basic and custom shapes
                        Putting graphics in their place: Use the coordinate system to draw SVG shapes and text at different scales and positions
                        Artistic touches: Explore how color is used, how strokes are created and manipulated, and how graphical effects like filters, clipping, and masking are applied
                        SVG as an application: Make your graphic more accessible to humans and computers, and learn how to make it interactive or animated

                        This is an exciting time to learn JavaScript. Now that the latest JavaScript specification—ECMAScript 6.0 (ES6)—has been finalized, learning how to develop high-quality applications with this language is easier and more satisfying than ever. This practical book takes programmers (amateurs and pros alike) on a no-nonsense tour of ES6, along with some related tools and techniques.

                        Author Ethan Brown (Web Development with Node and Express) not only guides you through simple and straightforward topics (variables, control flow, arrays), but also covers complex concepts such as functional and asynchronous programming. You’ll learn how to create powerful and responsive web applications on the client, or with Node.js on the server.
                        
                        Use ES6 today and transcompile code to portable ES5
                        Translate data into a format that JavaScript can use
                        Understand the basic usage and mechanics of JavaScript functions
                        Explore objects and object-oriented programming
                        Tackle new concepts such as iterators, generators, and proxies
                        Grasp the complexities of asynchronous programming
                        Work with the Document Object Model for browser-based apps
                        Learn Node.js fundamentals for developing server-side applications

                        HTML5 is still evolving, yet browsers such as Safari, Mozilla, Opera, and Chrome already support many of its features -- and mobile browsers are even farther ahead. HTML5: Up & Running carefully guides you though the important changes in this version with lots of hands-on examples, including markup, graphics, and screenshots. You'll learn how to use HTML5 markup to add video, offline capabilities, and more -- and you’ll be able to put that functionality to work right away.

                This book will provide a brief background on REST and the tools it provides (well known and not so well
                known). Understand how there is more to REST than just JSON and URLs. You will then cover and compare
                the maintained modules currently available in the npm community, including Express, Restify, Vatican,
                and Swagger. Finally you will code an example API from start to finish, using a subset of the tools
                covered.

                The Node community is currently flooded with modules; some of them are published once and never updated
                again - cluttering the entire universe of packages. Pro REST API Development with Node.js shines light
                into that black hole of modules for the developers trying to create an API. Understand REST API
                development with Node.js using this book today.

                If you’re an experienced PHP developer, you already have a head start on learning how to write Node.js
                code. In this book, author Daniel Howard demonstrates the remarkable similarities between the two
                languages, and shows you how to port your entire PHP web application to Node.js. By comparing specific
                PHP features with their Node counterparts, you’ll also discover how to refactor and improve existing PHP
                4 or PHP 5 source code.

                At the end, you’ll have two fully functional codebases to provide to your users. You can update both of
                them simultaneously, using this book as a reference to important aspects of PHP and Node.js.

                Use a simple Node.js framework to convert individual PHP pages to Node.js files
                Refactor blocking PHP source code to non-blocking Node.js source code that uses callbacks
                Convert PHP syntax, variables, and types to Node.js
                Use a step-by-step technique for implementing PHP classes and class inheritance in Node.js
                Convert PHP file handling APIs into their Node.js equivalents
                Compare approaches for using a MySQL database in Node.js and PHP
                Convert PHP code for JSON or XML APIs into Node.js code for npm packages

                Node: Up and Running
                Scalable Server-Side Code with JavaScript
                By Tom Hughes-Croucher, Mike Wilson

                Publisher: O'Reilly Media

                Release Date: April 2012

                Pages: 204
                This book introduces you to Node, the new web development framework written in JavaScript. You'll learn
                hands-on how Node makes life easier for experienced JavaScript developers: not only can you work on the
                front end and back end in the same language, you'll also have more flexibility in choosing how to divide
                application logic between client and server.

                Written by a core contributor to the framework, Node: Up and Running shows you how Node scales up to
                support large numbers of simultaneous connections across multiple servers, and scales down to let you
                create quick one-off applications with minimal infrastructure. Built on the V8 JavaScript engine that
                runs Google Chrome, Node is already winning the hearts and minds of many companies, including Google and
                Yahoo! This book shows you why.

                Understand Node's event-loop architecture, non-blocking I/O, and event-driven programming
                Discover how Node supports a variety of database and data storage tools
                Learn best practices for writing easy-to-maintain code for Node
